# MEALS APP

A new Flutter project.

I leave here another small fragment of an app, in this case an app that simulates food recipes. The purpose of this app was to practice and deepen knowledge in:

Navigation theory: Screen,Router,Pages.Flutter navigations allows.

Passing data,

Tabs,

Drawers & dialogs: Incorporation of side menu with options.

As you can see in the video, the filters option works! In this case I chose vegetarian and vegan food, automatically the hamburger came out of the list of recipes.

The add favorites and remove function also works fine.

The recipes have their cooking time, difficulty, ingredients and all necessary information.

I hope you liked it.
